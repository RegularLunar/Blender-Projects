## Lighting

- The HDR lighting was tested exclusively with Nea and may not produce optimal results with other characters.
- Adjust HDR settings within the Shading tab, focusing on Location, Rotation, Scale, Gamma, Sky, and Sun parameters.
- Ensure you're in Cycles with GPU Compute selected.
- A point light option is available for additional lighting effects.

## Camera

- Modify the camera in pose mode, easily accessible via Control+Tab to switch between object and pose mode.
- For Dead by Daylight (DBD) icons, use 512x512 at 300% scale for a 1536x1536 resolution in-game.

## Extra

- BHVR uses Post-FX for icons; in Blender, focus on adjusting saturation and shadow darkness for similar effects.
